1B,1600,AC,"implementation, maths",The tricky part is to realize there's no leading 0's and we need to find a way to convert the second type to the first. That's the hardest part. ,"isnum, isalpha, stoi",Should type faster and don’t waste much time on implementations. Then realize how to convert the number to the string. Done. ,20min
158B,1100,AC,greedy,"Implementation is a bit tricky, we need to count the numbers of 1,2,3,4. Then pair them. ",,Next time go directly on greedy and then implement faster.,20min
431C,1600,AC,dp,"It is easy to think about a 2 rows vector. One with the constraint d, the other without. Then compute the one without d first. In the end, compute the one with the constraint. ",,A bit slow when constructing the dp table. Next time don't waste too much time on thinking. Writing down something first should boost the coding process. Boundaries are easier to think when you watch it. Also we should probably combine the code in the same loop as the tutorial said. ,35min
