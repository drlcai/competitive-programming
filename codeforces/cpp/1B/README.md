Difficulty: 1600. Time: 1hour.

This took me an hour to implement, which should not be the case. The problem is easy to understand and a bit complicated to implement.

* For strings starting with R, there are two different cases: R23, or R23C14.

Another thing is to convert a number to letters for columns, 
we need to be careful but the good thing is thinking about 25,26,52,53 will help to find out the solution.
The other direction is much simpler. 

I wasted some time on reviewing c++ string and methods like `to_string, isalpha, isdigit, stoi`.
I always have some fear about using such methods, hope this time I can memorize all of them.
