Difficulty: 900. Time: 1 hour 30 mins

I made a mistake on this one so I got wrong answer all the time. I thought the worst one is the one
who caused the most dmg, but this is totally wrong. The most dangerous one is the one with the most
dmg, becuase a greedy strategy is to use your low hp to kill the most dangerous monster. 

Note that the key is to find the monster who has the last hit with you and 
bear in mind that this guy should be able to give you chance to stand until the last hit.
The monster should have the largest value of dmg.

This problem though, is a little educational because on this one I reviewd priority
queues in C++.
