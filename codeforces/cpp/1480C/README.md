Difficulty: 1700. Time: 50 min

This one is a new form of problems for me.

Essentially it is a binary search. The idea is simple, the local min is a number with decreasing
on the left and increasing on the right. 

After realizing this we just need to do a binary search and each time we check 3 values. That's it.
